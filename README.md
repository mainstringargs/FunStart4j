# FunStart4j
A Java Webstart Alternative technology with support for JNLPs.

Since Java WebStart is being deprecated (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46904795/java-web-start-support-in-java-9-and-beyond) FunStart4j is intended to work with your existing JNLPs to run your WebStart app just by downloading a jar and pointing it at your JNLP file.
